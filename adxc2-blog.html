      <p class="fw-bold">January 19, 2024</p>
      <p>The time has finally come! This Friday, January 19th, the second edition of the Abu Dhabi Extreme Championship
        landed in the UAE, bringing the fearsome ADXC cage and its battle-hungry competitors to the modern Mubadala
        Arena in the heart of the country. After its successful debut back in November, the tournament returned with its
        dazzling show of lights and some memorable battles between key players from the Jiu-Jitsu, grappling, and MMA
        scene.</p>
      <p>After 14 incredible battles, the ADXC 2 confirms that the success of its debut was not a one-time deal.
        Starting with the Grappling Main Event, Aljamain Sterling and Chase Hooper were completely on fire during the
        match. From start to finish, both fighters went all out as they sought takedowns and submissions, with Aljamain
        using his experience and conditioning to counter the hungry Hooper, who was always ready to use a spin to land
        his opponent in a sticky situation. With the competitors refusing to slow down throughout all five rounds, the
        match could’ve gone either way, but Sterling’s performance caught the eyes of the judges and the former UFC
        champion left the ADXC cage with yet another high-profile victory in his stacked record.</p>
      <div class="my-3">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/image-5.jpeg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>Before that, in the Jiu-Jitsu Main Event, the calm and collected Bruno Lima not only withstood the pressure
        from the explosive Manuel Ribamar but also found all the right opportunities to counter his attacks and emerge
        victorious. With his judo background shining on the battlefield, Lima pulled off amazing takedowns and got close
        to submitting more than once, but Ribamar didn’t slow down and kept attempting pulls, sweeps, and all the other
        tricks up his sleeve to try and get the drop on his opponent. Another factor that played a major part in Bruno’s
        victory was his deft use of the cage to both attack and defend, effectively wielding his surroundings as another
        weapon against Ribamar in order to come out on top of the duel.</p>
      <div class="my-3">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/image-4.jpeg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        In the Grappling Co-Main Event, Ffion Davies once again showed why she’s considered one of the best grapplers in
        the world, going all-out from the start against Luane Pinheiro, attempting a guillotine and then locking her
        opponent’s back in the cage with extreme pressure. Luana’s suffering, however, was short-lived, as Ffion quickly
        slipped to the back and locked the rear naked choke with less than a minute in the very first round, taking the
        win in the fastest match of the tournament.</p>
      <div class="my-3">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/image-6.jpeg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>On the other hand, the Jiu-Jitsu Co-Main Event was a technical battle between guard players, with Espen
        Mathiesen and Pablo Lavaselli putting their skills to the test against one another. In the end, Espen rose as
        the victor but not before five rounds of a very well-balanced match, with both fighters showing equal prowess
        fighting on top and bottom. In the final moments of the last round, Pablo managed to pass the guard, but by then
        Espen had already shown enough skills to ever so slightly tip the scales in his favor, taking the win via split
        decision in the ADXC cage.</p>
      <p>The Main and Preliminary cards also held some of the greatest matches in the ADXC 2 so, without further ado,
        let’s check out how each of the fights played out!</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Rinat Fakhredinov vs. Douglas Lima</p>
      <p>Armed with his top-tiered wrestling, the Russian Rinat Fakhredinov gave the Brazilian Douglas Lima almost no
        room to attack, using single and double-leg takedowns to throw his opponent around, always making a point to
        apply pressure as he attempted to penetrate Douglas’ defenses. The Brazilian even tried a couple of attacks,
        most notably two triangles in the second round, but Rinat quickly brushed off the submission attempts and
        carried on dominating the match. With a guillotine almost locked in the final seconds of the third round, Rinat
        emerged as the winner via the referees’ unanimous decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Talison Costa vs. Ali Monfaradi</p>
      <p>In a rematch of the ADWPJJC 2023 Master 1 division, the rivals Talison Costa and Ali Monfaradi went toe-to-toe
        in the ADXC cage, trading attacks and counter-attacks over the course of all three rounds. Hungry for some
        well-deserved payback after the setback in November, Talison Costa made his way into the cage ready to show all
        of his tricks, using takedowns and sweeps to destabilize his opponent as he tried to lock a submission. Ali
        pushed back with techniques of his own and some pressure on the cage wall, but Talison’s attacks won over the
        majority of the referees, who gave him the victory via split decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Sidney Outlaw vs. Terrance McKinney</p>
      <p>In a blink-and-you-miss-it moment, Sidney Outlaw got the upper hand over Terrance McKinney and landed a
        submission to rise as the victor in Abu Dhabi. The match started with McKinney on the attack, spinning on the
        ground, grabbing Sidney, and then pressing the Bellator athlete against the wall of the cage as he attempted to
        climb his back. However, Outlaw held on just long enough for a gap in McKinney’s defense to show up, allowing
        him to throw the UFC fighter to the ground, taking the back and closing the bout with a vicious crossface in the
        first round.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Gabriel Sousa vs. Yuta Shimada</p>
      <p>In another balanced grappling duel in the ADXC cage, Gabriel Sousa and Yuta Shimada gave each other no easy
        time as they clashed in the three regulated rounds of the tournament. While Gabriel used his technical prowess
        to keep Yuta on his toes, the latter made great use of his judo background and environmental awareness,
        frequently using the cage walls as a tool for both offense and defense. With his heftier arsenal and more
        dangerous attacks, Gabriel did more than enough to sway the referees, who unanimously gave him the win.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Pouya Rahmani vs. Denzel Freeman</p>
      <p>In a battle of giants in the ADXC cage, Denzel Freeman and Pouya Rahmani gave fight fans a fun duel, filled
        with powerful wrestling throws and displays of physical strength. Rahmani completely dominated the match both
        standing and on the ground, going as far as taking the back of his opponent twice and quickly brushing off any
        attacks made by Freeman, safely taking the win via the referees’ unanimous decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Shay Montague vs. Omar Al Suwaidi</p>
      <p>An intense exchange between Montague and Al Suwaidi in the last Preliminary Card fight. Starting the match
        aiming to take down, Omar set the tone throughout the entire first round, but Montague did a full 180 in the
        second round, using his berimbolo spins and attacking on the neck while avoiding Omar’s advances. After a very
        balanced third round, Shay Montague became the winner via split decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Matus Arpas vs. Ahmed Amir</p>
      <p>Matus and Ahmed led a high-octane match in the ADXC cage. With a lot of attacks going around, Matus exerted
        pressure on Ahmed’s defense during the first round, with Ahmed showing a better performance in the following
        round but still being unable to fully contain his opponent’s advances and almost falling victim to a dangerous
        guillotine. The third and final round did not dial down on the action, with both sides dishing out attacks and
        defenses in almost equal measure. With a more dynamic and effective performance, Matus Arpas was unanimously
        chosen as the victor by the referees.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Emily Ferreira vs. Yara Kakish</p>
      <p>The American Emily Ferreira carved her name as one of the ADXC winners after overcoming Jordan’s Yara Kakish in
        the tournament’s third fight. Working well on top and bottom, Ferreira’s guard gave her all the tools she needed
        to land the right attack on the final round. After attacking with a triangle, Emily did not slow down and went
        for an armbar, fully stretching Kakish’s arm to win.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Mohammed Al Suwaidi vs. SeongHyeon Joo</p>
      <p>The first grappling fight in the card did not disappoint. Mohammed and SeongHyeon showed a lot of skills with
        their takedowns and control on top. Al Suwaidi maintained control throughout the match, taking his South Korean
        opponent to the ground in all three rounds, in addition to his more effective attacks. The result came about via
        the referees, who unanimously chose Mohammed Al Suwaidi as the winner.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Yaroslav Rymasjevkii vs. Alinur Kuatuly</p>
      <p>Opening the ADXC 2 card, promising up-and-comers Yaroslav and Alinur showed their skills as they each played to
        their strengths in hopes of seizing the victory. Playing below, Yaroslav opened his toolbox and constantly
        attempted submissions while Alinur used his technical know-how to control the attacks and reach side control.
        With triangle attempts and a lot of movements with foot locks and x guardm Yaroslav won over all the referees
        and became the very first winner of the tournament.</p>
