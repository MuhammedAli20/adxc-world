      <h2 class="text-uppercase text-center text-white">ADXC Judging Criteria/Scoring</h2>
      <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-center">2023 Unified Rules of ADXC</h5>
      <div class="judging px-md-5 px-3 my-3">
        <p class="text-white py-3 text-start">The 10 point must system is defined as follows:</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Scoring:</h5>
        <p class="text-white py-3 text-start">All bouts will be evaluated and scored by three judges. The 10-Point Must
          System will be the standard system of scoring a bout. Under the 10-Point Must Scoring System, 10 points must
          be awarded to the winner of the round and nine points or less must be awarded to the loser, except for an even
          round, which is scored (10-10).</p>
        <p class="text-white pb-3 text-start">Effective Grappling shall be considered the first priority of round
          assessments. Effective Aggressiveness is a ‘Plan B’ and should not be considered unless the judge does not see
          ANY advantage in the Effective Grappling realm. Fighting Area Control (‘Plan C’) should only be needed when
          ALL other criteria are 100% even for both competitors. This will be an extremely rare occurrence.</p>
        <h4 class="text-uppercase text-white pb-3 text-start">PRIORITIZED CRITERIA:</h4>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Effective Grappling</h5>
        <p class="text-white pb-3 text-start">“Legal techniques that have immediate or cumulative impact with the
          potential to contribute towards the end of the match with the IMMEDIATE weighing in more heavily than the
          cumulative impact. Successful execution of takedowns, submission attempts, reversals and the achievement of
          advantageous positions that produce immediate or cumulative impact with the potential to contribute to the end
          of the match, with the IMMEDIATE weighing more heavily than the cumulative impact.” It shall be noted that a
          successful takedown is not merely a changing of position, but the establishment of an attack from the use of
          the takedown. Top and bottom position fighters are assessed more on the impactful/effective result of their
          actions, more so than their position. This criterion will be the deciding factor in a high majority of
          decisions when scoring a round. The next two criteria must be treated as a backup and used ONLY when Effective
          Grappling is 100% equal for the round.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Effective Aggressiveness</h5>
        <p class="text-white py-3 text-start">“Aggressively making attempts to finish the fight. The key term is
          ‘effective’. Chasing after an opponent with no effective result or impact should not render in the judges’
          assessments.” Effective Aggressiveness is only to be assessed if Effective Grappling is 100% equal for both
          competitors.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Fighting Area Control</h5>
        <p class="text-white py-3 text-start">“Fighting area control is assessed by determining who is dictating the
          pace, place and position of the match.” Fighting Area Control” shall only be assessed if Effective Grappling
          and Effective Aggressiveness is 100% equal for both competitors. This will be assessed very rarely.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">ROUND SCORING: 10–10 Round</h5>
        <p class="text-white py-3 text-start">A 10 – 10 round in ADXC is when both fighters have competed for whatever
          duration of time in the round and there is no difference or advantage between either fighter. A 10 – 10 round
          in ADXC should be extremely rare and is not a score to be used as an excuse by a judge that cannot assess the
          differences in the round. A 10 – 10 round in ADXC is a necessity to have for the judge’s possible score,
          mainly due to scoring incomplete rounds. It is possible to have a round where both fighters engage for 3
          minutes and at the end of the 3-minute time period the output, impact, effectiveness and overall competition
          between the two fighters is exactly the same. It is possible, but highly unlikely. If there is any discernible
          difference between the two fighters during the round the judge shall not give the score of 10 – 10. Again,
          this score will be extremely rare.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">10 9 Round</h5>
        <p class="text-white py-3 text-start">A 10 – 9 Round in ADXC is where one combatant wins the round by a close
          margin. A 10 – 9 round in ADXC is the most common score a judge assesses during the night. If, during the
          round, the judge sees a fighter applies the better techniques, or utilize effective grappling during the
          competition, even if by just one technique over their opponent, the judge shall give the winning fighter a
          score of 10 while assessing the losing fighter a score of 9 or less. It is imperative that judges understand
          that a score of 9 is not an automatic numerical score given to the losing fighter of the round. The judge must
          consider: Was the fighter engaged in offensive actions during the round? Did the losing fighter compete with
          an attitude of attempting to win the fight, or just to survive the offensive actions of their opponent? A
          score of 10 – 9 can reflect an extremely close round or a round of marginal domination and/or impact.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">10 8 Round</h5>
        <p class="text-white pt-3 text-start">A 10 – 8 Round in ADXC is where one fighter wins the round by a large
          margin. A 10 – 8 round in ADXC is not the most common score a judge will render, but it is absolutely
          essential to the evolution of the sport and the fairness to the fighters that judges understand and
          effectively utilize the score of 10 – 8. A score of 10 – 8 does not require a fighter to dominate their
          opponent for 3 minutes of a round. The score of 10 – 8 is utilized by the judge when the judge sees verifiable
          actions on the part of either fighter. Judges shall ALWAYS give a score of 10 – 8 when the judge has
          established that one fighter has dominated the action of the round, had duration of the domination and also
          impacted their opponent with either effective strikes or effective grappling maneuvers that have diminished
          the abilities of their opponent. Judges must CONSIDER giving the score of 10 – 8 when a fighter shows
          dominance in the round even though no impactful scoring against the opponent was achieved.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">ADXC is an offensive based sport. No scoring is given for defensive maneuvers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Using smart, tactically sound defensive maneuvers allows the fighter to stay in
          the fight and to be competitive.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Dominance in the grappling phase can be seen by fighters taking DOMINANT
          POSITIONS in the fight and utilizing those positions to attempt fight ending submissions or attacks. If a
          fighter has little to no offensive output during a 3 minute round, it should be normal for the judge to
          consider awarding the losing fighter 8 points instead of 9. Judges must CONSIDER giving the score of 10 – 8
          when a fighter IMPACTS their opponent significantly in a round even though they do not dominate the action.
          Effectiveness in grappling which leads to a diminishing of a fighter’s energy, confidence, abilities and
          spirit.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">All of these come as a direct result of negative impact. When a fighter is hurt
          with strikes, showing a lack of control or ability, these can be defining moments in the fight. If a judge
          sees that a fighter has been significantly damaged in the round the judge should CONSIDER the score of 10 – 8.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">10 7 Round</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">A 10 – 7 Round in ADXC is when a fighter completely overwhelms their opponent
          in Effective Grappling and stoppage is warranted. A 10 – 7 round in ADXC is a score that judges will rarely
          give. It takes both overwhelming DOMINANCE of a round, but also significant IMPACT that, at times, cause the
          judge to consider that the fight could be stopped. Judges shall look for multiple IMPACTFUL blows or
          knockdowns that diminish the fighter, and/or grappling maneuvers that place the fighter in dominant situations
          with impact being inflicted that visibly diminishes the fighter’s ability to compete.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Impact</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">A judge shall assess if a fighter impacts their opponent significantly in the
          round, even though they may not have dominated the action. Impact shall also be assessed when a fighter’s
          actions, using grappling, lead to a diminishing of their opponents’ energy, confidence, abilities and spirit.
          All of these come as a direct result of impact. When a fighter is impacted with technique, by lack of control
          and/or ability, this can create defining moments in the round and shall be assessed with great value.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Dominance </h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">As ADXC is an offensive based sport, dominance of a round can be seen in
          grappling when the losing fighter is forced to continually defend, with no counters or reaction taken when
          openings</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">present themselves. Dominance in the grappling phase can be seen by fighters
          taking dominant positions in the fight and utilizing those positions to attempt fight-ending submissions or
          attacks. Merely holding a dominant position(s) shall not be a primary factor in assessing dominance. What the
          fighter does with those positions is what must be assessed.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">In the absence of dominance in the grappling phase, as set forth in paragraph 3
          of the promulgated rules, to be considered dominate, there must be a singularly or in combination, some types
          of submission attempts or an overwhelming pace which is measured by improved or aggressive positional changes
          that cause the losing fighter to consistently be in a defensive or reactive mode</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Duration</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Duration is defined by the time spent by one fighter effectively attacking,
          controlling and impacting their opponent; while the opponent offers little to no offensive output. A judge
          shall assess duration by recognizing the relative time in a round when one fighter takes and maintains full
          control of the effective offense. This can be assessed both standing and grounded.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Fouls (with explanations where warranted):</h5>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li class="py-md-3">Strikes of any kind and/or grabbing the trachea: No strikes are allowed. A fighter may not
            gouge their fingers or thumb into their opponent’s neck or trachea in an attempt to submit their opponent.
          </li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Butting with the head: The head may not be used as a striking instrument in any fashion.
            Any
            use of the head as a striking instrument whether head to head, head to body or otherwise is illegal.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Eye gouging of any kind: Eye gouging by means of fingers, chin, or elbow, strikes or
            punches
            is illegal.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Biting or spitting at an opponent: Biting in any form is illegal. A fighter must recognize
            that a referee may not be able to physically observe some actions, and must make the referee aware if they
            are being bitten during an exhibition of unarmed combat.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Fish Hooking: Any attempt by a fighter to use their fingers in a manner that attacks
            their
            opponent’s mouth, nose or ears, stretching the skin to that area will be considered “Fish hooking”. Fish
            hooking generally is the placing of fingers into the mouth of your opponent and pulling your hands in
            opposing directions while holding onto the skin of your opponent.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Hair pulling: Pulling of the hair in any fashion is an illegal action. A fighter may not
            grab
            a hold of their opponent’s hair to control their opponent in any way. If a fighter has long hair, they may
            not use their hair as a tool for holding or choking in any fashion</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Spiking the opponent to the canvas onto the head or neck (pile-driving): A pile driver is
            considered to be any throw where you control your opponent’s body placing their feet towards the sky with
            their head straight down and then forcibly drive your opponents head into the canvas or flooring material.
            It should be noted when a fighter is placed into a submission hold by their opponent, if that fighter is
            capable of elevating their opponent they may bring that opponent down in any fashion they desire because
            they are not in control of their opponent’s body. The fighter who is attempting the submission can either
            adjust their position or let go of their hold before being slammed to the canvas.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Fingers outstretched toward an opponent’s face/eyes: In the standing position, a fighter
            that
            moves their arm(s) toward their opponent with an open hand, fingers pointing at the opponent’s face/eyes,
            will be a foul. Referees are to prevent this dangerous behavior by communicating clearly to fighters.
            Fighters are directed to close their fists or point their fingers straight up in the air when reaching
            toward their opponent.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Groin attacks of any kind: Any attack to the groin area including, striking, grabbing,
            pinching or twisting is illegal. It should be clear that groin attacks are the same for men and women.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Stomping of a grounded fighter: Stomping is considered any type of striking action with
            the
            feet where the fighter lifts their leg up bending their leg at the knee and initiating a striking action
            with the bottom of their foot or heel.</li>
          <li class="py-3"> Holding opponent’s shorts or rashguards: A fighter may not control their opponent’s movement
            by holding onto their opponent’s shorts or rashguards. It is legal to hold onto your own shorts</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Holding or grabbing the fence with fingers or toes: A fighter may put their hands or feet
            on
            the fence and push off of it at any time. A fighter may place their hands or feet onto the cage and have
            their fingers or toes go through the fencing material at any time. When a fighter’s fingers or toes go
            through the cage and grab hold of the fence and start to control either their body position or their
            opponent’s body position it now becomes an ILLEGAL action. If a fighter is caught holding the fence or cage
            material the referee shall issue a one-point deduction from the offending fighter’s scorecard if the foul
            caused a substantial effect in the fight. If a fighter grabs hold of the cage and because of the infraction,
            the fouling fighter ends up in a superior position due to the foul, the fighters should be re-started by the
            referee, standing in a neutral position after determining if a point deduction is appropriate</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Small joint manipulation: Fighters must grab the majority of fingers or toes for use as
            defense or manipulation. Fingers and toes are small joints. Wrists, ankles, knees, shoulders and elbows are
            all large joints.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Throwing an opponent out of the fighting area: A fighter shall not throw their opponent
            out
            of the ring or cage.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Intentionally placing a finger into any orifice, or into any cut or laceration of your
            opponent: A fighter may not place their fingers into an open laceration in an attempt to enlarge the cut. A
            fighter may not place their fingers into an opponent’s, nose, ears, mouth, or any body cavity</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Clawing, pinching, twisting the flesh: Any attack that targets the fighter’s skin by
            clawing
            at the skin or attempting to pull or twist the skin to apply pain is illegal.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Timidity avoiding contact, or consistently dropping the mouthpiece, or faking an injury:
            Timidity is defined as any fighter who purposely avoids contact with their opponent, or runs away from the
            action of the fight. Timidity can also be called by the referee for any attempt by a fighter to receive time
            by falsely claiming a foul, injury, or purposely dropping or spitting out their mouthpiece or other action
            designed to stall or delay the action of the fight</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Use of abusive language in the fighting area. The use of abusive language is not allowed
            during ADXC competition. It is the sole responsibility of the referee to determine when language crosses
            over the line to abusive. It should be clear that fighters can talk during a match. The mere use of auditory
            language is not a violation of this rule. Examples of abusive language would be racially motivated or
            derogatory language.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Flagrant disregard of the referee’s instructions: A fighter MUST follow the instructions
            of
            the referee at all times. Any deviation or noncompliance may result in points being deducted from the
            fighter’s scorecard, or the fighter being disqualified from the match.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Unsportsmanlike conduct that causes an injury to the opponent. Every athlete competing in
            the sport of ADXC is expected to represent the sport in a positive light emphasizing sportsmanship and
            humility. Any athlete that disrespects the rules of the sport or attempts to inflict unnecessary harm on a
            competitor who has been either taken out of the competition by the referee or has tapped out of the
            competition shall be viewed as being unsportsmanlike.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Attacking an opponent after the bell has sounded at the end of the period of unarmed
            combat.
            The end of a round is signified by the sound of the bell and the call of time by the referee. Once the
            referee has made the call of time, any offensive actions initiated by the fighter shall be considered after
            the bell and illegal</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Attacking an opponent on or during the break: A fighter shall not engage their opponent
            in
            any fashion during a time-out or break of action in competition</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">Attacking an opponent who is under the care of the referee. Once the referee has called
            for a
            stop of the action to protect a fighter who has been incapacitated or is unable to continue to compete in
            the fight, fighters shall cease all offensive actions against their opponent.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Interference from a fighter’s corner or seconds: Interference is defined as any action or
            activity aimed at disrupting the fight or causing an unfair advantage to be given to one combatant. Corners
            are not allowed to distract the referee or influence the actions of the referee in any fashion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Scoring the foul to be performed by the Scorekeeper Fouls may result in a point
          being deducted by the official scorekeeper from the offending ADXC fighter’s score. The scorekeeper, not the
          judges, will be responsible for calculating the true score after factoring in the point deduction.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Only a referee can assess a foul. If the referee does not call the foul, judges
          shall not make that assessment on their own and cannot factor such into their scoring calculations.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Foul Procedures</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">If a foul is committed, the referee shall:</p>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li class="py-md-3">call time;</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">check the fouled fighter’s condition and safety; and</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">assess the foul to the offending contestant, deduct points, and notify each corner’s
            seconds,
            judges and the official scorekeeper.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-white text-start">If a bottom contestant commits a foul, unless the top contestant is injured,
          the fight shall continue, so as not to jeopardize the top contestant’s superior positioning at the time.</p>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li class="py-md-3">The referee shall verbally notify the bottom contestant of the foul.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">When the round is over, the referee shall assess the foul and notify both corners’
            seconds,
            the judges and the official scorekeeper.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> The referee may terminate a bout based on the severity of a foul. For such a flagrant
            foul,
            a contestant shall lose by disqualification.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Time Considerations for Fouls</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">A fighter who has been struck with a low blow is allowed up to five minutes to
          recover from the foul as long as in the ringside doctor’s opinion the fighter may possibly continue on in the
          contest. If the fighter states that they can continue on before the five minutes of time have expired, the
          referee shall as soon as practical restart the fight. If the fighter goes over the five minute time allotment
          the fight cannot be restarted and the contest must come to an end with the outcome determined by the round and
          time in which the fight was stopped.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Time Considerations for Fouls</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">If a contest or exhibition of ADXC is stopped because of an accidental foul,
          the referee shall determine whether the unarmed combatant who has been fouled can continue or not. If the
          unarmed combatant’s chance of winning has not been seriously jeopardized as a result of the foul and if the
          foul did not involve a concussive impact to the head of the unarmed combatant who has been fouled, the referee
          may order the contest or exhibition continued after a recuperative interval of not more than five minutes.
          Immediately after separating the unarmed combatants, the referee shall inform the Commission’s representative
          of their determination that the foul was accidental.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">If a fighter is fouled by a blow that the referee deems illegal, the referee
          should stop the action and call for time. The referee may take the injured fighter to the ringside doctor and
          have the ringside doctor examine the fighter as to their ability to continue on in the contest. The ringside
          doctor has up to five minutes to make their determination. If the ringside doctor determines that the fighter
          can continue in the contest, the referee shall as soon as practical restart the fight.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">However, unlike the low blow foul rule, the fighter does not have up to five
          minutes of time to use at their discretion.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">If the referee stops the contest and employs the use of the ringside doctor,
          the ringside physician’s examinations shall not exceed five minutes. If five minutes is exceeded, the fight
          cannot be re-started and the contest must end.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Scoring of incomplete rounds</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">There should be scoring of an incomplete round. If the referee penalizes either
          contestant, then the appropriate points shall be deducted when the scorekeeper calculates the final score for
          the partial round.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Tap out I. Submission by Tap Out:</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">When a contestant physically uses their hand to indicate that they no longer
          wish to continue; or ii. Verbal tap out: When a contestant verbally announces to the referee that they do not
          wish to continue or makes audible sounds such as screams indicating pain or discomfort</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">FIGHTING AREA ( Ring / Cage )</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">All ADXC contests will take place in either a Cage or a Ring that has been
          approved by the Commission. The Cage or Ring will meet the requirements set forth by each Commission and also
          be subject to inspection prior to each event by a Commission representative such as a referee.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase text-white  text-start">Cages</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">The fighting area canvas shall be no smaller than 18 feet by 18 feet and no
          larger than 32 feet by 32 feet. The fighting area canvas shall be padded in a manner as approved by the
          Commission, with at least one inch layer of foam padding.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Padding shall extend beyond the fighting area and over the edge of the
          platform. No vinyl or other plastic rubberized covering shall be permitted.</p>
        <p class="text-white pb-3 text-start">The fighting area canvas shall not be more than four feet above the floor
          of the building and shall have suitable steps or ramp for use by the participants. Posts shall be made of
          metal not more than six inches in diameter, extending from the floor of the building to a minimum height of 58
          inches above the fighting area canvas and shall be properly padded in a manner approved by the Commission. The
          fighting area canvas area shall be enclosed by a fence made of such material as will not allow a fighter to
          fall out or break through it onto the floor or spectators, including, but not limited to, vinyl coated chain
          link fencing. All metal parts shall be covered and padded in a manner approved by the Commission and shall not
          be abrasive to the contestants. The fence shall provide two separate entries onto the fighting area canvas.
        </p>

        <h5 class="text-uppercase pt-3 text-white  text-start">RULE MEETINGS ( General Guidelines )</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">In ADXC, group rule meetings will be commonplace in the reviewing of rules,
          fouls and other considerations.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">It is recommended that individual meetings between the bout supervising referee
          and each competitor in the contest be conducted backstage in the locker room or another appropriate location.
          Many times contestants will ask questions of the official</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">when the rules are covered individually in private, when they would have been
          hesitant to ask the same question in front of their competitor. This also allows the referee to observe any
          peculiar idiosyncrasies of the fighter, such as an odd speech pattern, nervous tics, or different eye colors.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">This does not supersede the ability of the ADXC Commission to have a general
          rules meeting about the requirements and also discuss items such as a fighter’s time to report, the location,
          interaction with the inspectors, available liquids and foods, taping requirements and so on, with all the
          fighters gathered en masse.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">It is recommended that the unwritten custom of the one pound allowance for
          non-title bouts be continued, but only if provided for in the written bout contract or by regulation.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Commissions may also approve catchweight bouts, subject to their review and
          discretion. For example, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest if it feels that the contest
          would still be fair, safe and competitive if a set catch weight is set in advance at 73 kilos, for example.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">In addition, if one athlete weighs in at 120 kilos while the opponent weighs in
          at 122, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest if it feels that the contest would still be fair
          and competitive. This would be despite the fact that the two athletes weighed in at differing weight classes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Commissions should establish and make known to promoters the maximum allowable
          weight differences for contestants for each weight class.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase pt-3 text-white  text-start">Use of Vaseline and other similar substances</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">Absolutely “no” body grease, gels, balms, lotions oils, or other substances may
          be applied to the hair, face or body. This includes the use of excessive amounts of water “dumped” on a
          contestant to make them slippery. However, Vaseline may be applied solely to the facial area at cage side or
          ringside in the presence of an inspector, referee, or a person designated by the commission. Any contestant
          applying anything other than Vaseline in an approved fashion at the appropriate time could be penalized a
          point or subject to loss by disqualification.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase pt-3 text-white  text-start">Double Knockout Situations</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">The referee shall stop a contest or exhibition of unarmed combat at any stage
          if the referee determines that both unarmed combatants are in such a condition that to continue might subject
          the unarmed combatants to serious injury. If a contest or exhibition is stopped pursuant to this subsection,
          the decision shall be deemed to be a technical draw.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase pt-3 text-white  text-start">Fighter Appearance</h5>
        <p class="text-white text-start">It is recommended that a Commission inspector or referee bring a clipper and a
          file to each event and check the fingernail length of all contestants.</p>
        <h5 class="text-uppercase pt-3 text-white  text-start">Championship Tournament Policies
        </h5>
        <ul>
          <li class="py-md-3">ADXC will promote single elimination, grand prix style tournaments featuring fighters in a
            specified weight division. Fighters will be contracted for tournament bouts with provisions that include
            ADXC’s official tournament policies.

          </li>
          <li class="py-md-3">ADXC may specify “alternates”, or recognize bouts contested outside of the tournament
            brackets as official tournament “reserve matches” in order to define fighters other than the originally
            intended tournament participants who may be granted an opportunity to enter the tournament if circumstances
            necessitate it.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> Each tournament bout will be contested according to the rules approved by the presiding
            athletic commission or the ABC Unified Rules of ADXC.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> If a tournament bout other than the final ends in a “No-Contest” then the official bout
            result will be a “No-Contest”. o If the bout involves the champion, the champion will advance as having
            successfully defended their title, unless the Survivor Rule is applied. o If the bout does not involve the
            current champion, the three officials who were assigned to judge the bout will each cast a ballot in favor
            of the fighter who, “based on their performance in the portion of the bout that was contested” most deserves
            to advance in the tournament. The fighter who receives the majority of judges votes will advance unless that
            opportunity is withdrawn for due cause and the Survivor Rules is applied, or a tournament reserve match
            fighter or alternate is selected to advance in their place, or ADXC’s in its sole discretion elects to
            schedule a rematch.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">If a three-round tournament bout is scored a “draw”, the fighters will contest a fourth,
            “sudden victory” round to determine the winner, who will then advance in the tournament. If for any reason
            the sudden victory round fails to resolve the draw, the rules for addressing a draw in a five-round bout
            found immediately below will be applied.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> If a five-round tournament bout other than the final is scored a “draw”, the official
            result
            of that bout will be a “draw”. The following parameters will determine which fighter advances in the
            tournament. o If the bout involves the current champion for that weight division, that fighter, the
            champion, will have successfully defended their title and will advance in the tournament. o If the bout does
            not involve the current champion for that weight division, the three judges who scored the bout will each
            cast one additional ballot in favor of the fighter who in their opinion most deserves to advance in the
            tournament based on their performance in the “bout as a whole”. The fighter that the three judges select by
            majority vote based on this criterion will advance in the tournament.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3"> If a five-round tournament FINAL bout ends in a “No-Contest” or “No-Decision” the
            official
            result of that bout will be a “No-Contest” or “No-Decision”. The defending champion will retain their title
            but the tournament final will be considered unresolved and the tournament Champion, undetermined. ADXC
            reserves the right to determine if and/or when a rematch might be scheduled.</li>
          <li class="py-3">If a five-round tournament FINAL bout is scored a “draw”, the official result of that bout
            will be a “draw”. By merit of the draw, the defending champion will have retained their title and be deemed
            the tournament winner and Champion.</li>
          <li class="py-md-3">ADXC reserves the right and authority to resolve any circumstances pertaining to the
            tournament not specifically or entirely addressed in this document.</li>
