      <h2 class="text-uppercase danger-text">ADXC 4: Benoit Saint Denis, Espen Mathiesen, Ffion, Khaled, and all the
        champions who rose in France</h2>
      <div class="my-2">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/back-flag.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p class="fw-bold">May 18, 2024</p>
      <p>After weeks of anticipation, the ADXC 4 is now officially completed. This Saturday, May 18th, some of the best
        competitors from Jiu-Jitsu and Grappling entered the merciless ADXC cage and fought tooth and nail to become the
        newest champions born at the Dojo de Paris, in the capital of France.</p>
      <p>In the Grappling Main Event, the long-awaited duel between UFC powerhouses Benoit Saint Denis and Marc Diakiese
        gave fight fans everything they were hoping for and then some. Fighting in his homeland of France, Benoit used
        his grappling prowess to control the flow of the battle and emerge victorious in the ADXC cage. The fight almost
        ended quickly, with Benoit going for a neck attack and almost submitting in the very first round, but Diakiese’s
        top-notch defenses got him out of danger and kept the bout going, with many standing exchanges throughout the
        five rounds. But while Diakiese had some good moments, Benoit’s pressure was simply too much and the “God of
        War” left another foe in the dust, taking the win by unanimous decision and driving the crowd at the Dojo de
        Paris insane with the victory of their local champion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Espen Mathiesen spared no effort and is now a two-time champion of the ADXC. Fighting in the
        Jiu-Jitsu Main Event against France’s Leon Larman, the Norwegian athlete played to his strength and started the
        match by pulling and trying to use his berimbolo. Feeling the danger, Leon managed to avoid his opponent’s
        collar grips, but Espen spun and ended up in the foot. Going for the de la riva guard, Espen managed to get a
        better grip and got to the back, with Leon defending against the hooks but falling prey to a collar choke still
        in the first round.</p>
      <p>The Grappling Co-Main Event brought another victory for Wales’ Ffion Davies in the ADXC. After sweeping from
        the closed guard and maintaining Morgan Black under complete pressure in the first round, Ffion finished the job
        in the following one. When the fighting started again, Ffion pulled Morgan into her guard, went up reaching the
        side, and quickly mounted, seizing her opponent’s arm and landing the winning armbar with a little over a minute
        on the clock.</p>
      <p>In the Jiu-Jitsu Co-Main Event, Khaled Al Shehhi and Leonardo Mario found themselves evenly matched throughout
        the duel, which lasted five rounds of three minutes. Khaled started with a takedown, followed with a submission
        attempt and, when that didn’t work, used the single-leg to press Leonardo against the cage wall. Leonardo
        applied his pressure on Khaled’s guard, but the UAE powerhouse had a better run in the duel, using his technique
        to attack on top and even reach the side. When it was all said and done, Khaled had shown enough of his skills
        to convince the majority of the referees and conquer the title with a split decision.</p>

      </div>
      <p>While the Main and Co-Main Events were amazing in their own right, the ADXC 4 still had many impressive battles
        in its card. Check out below how the Main Card and Prelims Card matches went down!</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Abdul-Kareem Al Sewady vs. Amin Ayoub</p>
      <p>In another match-up between MMA athletes, Abdul-Kareem controlled the bout by putting pressure on Amin’s guard
        throughout the first two rounds, even managing to mount in the third round. Amin tried to attack with a
        guillotine, but Abdul-Kareem managed to avoid any danger and conquered the referees, who unanimously decided in
        favor of the “Pride of Palestine”.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Cassio Silva vs. Marko Oikarainen</p>
      <p>In an intense rematch from the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam Rome 2024, the French-based Brazilian Cassio Silva once
        again defeated Finland’s Marko Oikarainen. With triangle, arm, and omoplata attacks, Cassio was the most
        dangerous competitor, even if Marko’s solid defenses kept him safe and sound in all three rounds. At the end of
        the fight, Cassio tipped the scales even further in his favor with another dangerous attack, taking the win by
        unanimous decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Nathiely de Jesus vs. Elizabeth Mitrovic</p>
      <p>A very balanced duel between Nathiely and Elizabeth. With an active guard and dangerous sweep attempts, Eliza
        used her long legs to her favor against Nathiely, who used her experience and pressure from the top to control
        the duel. Being more active in the bout, Nathiely tried to take the back and even attacked the arm, convincing
        the referees and getting the win by unanimous decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Nia Blackman vs. Magdalena Loska</p>
      <p>A brown belt hailing from the UK, Nia Black showed her resolve as she sought to beat the Polish black belt
        Magdalena Loska. Starting with the upper hand after attacking with a loop choke and an omoplata, Magdalena kept
        herself active while Nia countered her foot attacks, with the latter almost taking the back on the second and
        third rounds. With better moves from the guard and almost taking the back, Nia convinced the majority of the
        referees and got the win via split decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Steven Ray vs. Ibrahima Mane</p>
      <p>In a duel between MMA veterans, Steven Ray proved himself an accomplished grappler. In the fight against
        Ibrahima, Steven had the best moves in the first and second rounds, going for foot and guillotine attacks. In
        the third round, with both fighters still standing, Steven set up another guillotine, took the fight to the
        ground, and got the submission with 2:05 on the clock.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Youness Bennouali vs. Florian Bayili</p>
      <p>A brown belt fighting in his home country of France, Youness had an interesting duel against the Belgian black
        belt Florian Bayili. Keeping steady on his feet, Youness controlled the match with some good takedowns and
        submission attempts following the takedowns. Meanwhile, Florian employed his guard from below, but by the time
        the match ended, Youness’ stamina and techniques were enough to convince the majority of the referees, who gave
        him the win via split decision.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Geovanny Martinez vs. Nicolas Renier</p>
      <p>10th Planet’s Geo Martinez used his grappling experience to make quick work of Nicolas Renier in the ADXC 4.
        The duel started with Geo pulling Nicolas into his closed guard and then quickly spinning around to reach the
        legs, locking a lightning-fast heel hook in just 27 seconds of the very first round.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Kalim Mastouri vs. Luca Anacoreta</p>
      <p>An intense match between Kalim and Luca heated up the Prelims. With both sides dishing out attacks throughout
        the three rounds of the duel, triangle chokes and leglocks were the name of the game here. One of the bout’s
        highlights happened in the third round when Kalim took Luca down with a collar drag and almost took the back,
        with the latter narrowly escaping the position. At the end of it all, the referees unanimously declared Kalim
        the winner.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Kasper Larsen vs. Alexander Alexandrov</p>
      <p>Kasper Larsen maintained the pressure throughout the fight, using his weight and technique to attack
        Alexander’s half-guard in the first two rounds. In the third round, after pushing Alexander against the cage
        wall, Kasper got Alexander down and quickly went for the back without the hooks, spinning below and entering a
        twister before locking the rear naked choke to take the victory.</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">Shamma Al Kalbani vs. Lina Grosset</p>
      <p>A well-balanced fight between purple belts Shamma Al Kalbani and Lina Grosset. With the former hailing from the
        UAE and the latter fighting in her home country of France, the first round saw both athletes exchanging foot
        attacks while the following one brought a little more movement, with reversals and guard passing attempts. The
        third and final round saw Lina putting a lot of pressure from the top, but Shamma dished out some sneaky attacks
        and, at the end of it all, managed to convince the majority of the referees, who gave her the win via split
        decision.</p>
